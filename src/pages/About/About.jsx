Sellers who previously had an Instagram profile shop and/or Facebook Page shop will be prompted to convert to Shops. Before setting up your shop, you will see an email or notification that you can now use Shops. Businesses with a linked Facebook Page shop and Instagram profile may be eligible to have a shared storefront across both Instagram and Facebook.
New sellers can create a shop in Commerce Manager. If you've never set up an Instagram profile shop and/or Facebook Page shop, you can create a shop in Commerce Manager. <br />
You can create collections to customise your shop and attract customers. You'll go to Commerce Manager to customise your shop and to create, arrange and customise your collections. Each collection will have a name, description, cover media and include at least two or more products. You can organise products into collections with a variety of themes that can help your customers find products that are right for them.
Shops showcase your brand and products in a native mobile experience. After publishing your shop, customers will be able to find it through the Facebook or Instagram app on Apple or Android devices. Your shop will be viewed in a full-screen immersive experience and your collections will be shown as personalised products to customers. When you add new inventory to your shop, people can see it in their Feed, on the Facebook Shop tab or get a notification to encourage them to visit your shop.
<br />
Shops provide a unified presence on Facebook, Instagram and Marketplace. Shop customisation features are unified across the family of apps. This means that if you have a shop that is accessible from both your Instagram profile and your Facebook Page, then your collections may be visible on both Instagram and Facebook. Your products can also be visible to buyers on Marketplace if you have a shop with checkout. Learn how to set up Marketplace as a sales channel in Commerce Manager.</p>
